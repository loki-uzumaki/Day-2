A blog on the difference between Document and Window Object

 In the world of web development,JavaScript plays a major in making web pages interactive and dynamic.Two fundamental objects in javascript,the `document and `window` objects,are frequently used to manipulate and access various aspects of web pages.

Document Object

The `document` object represents the entire web page or HTML document.It provides access to the content ,structure and elements of the document.Essentially,it acts as a container for all the HTML elements on the page,including elements like headings,paragraphs,images,forms and more.


Key Features Of The Document Object:

1.DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation: You can use the document object to access and modify the content of HTML elements. This allows to change text, attributes, and even add or remove elements from the page.

2.Selectors: The document object provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector to select and work with specific elements on the page.

3.Events: You can attach event listeners to elements in the document object, making it responsive to user interactions.


The Window Object

The window object represents the browser window or tab that displays the web page. It encompasses not only the content but also other browser-related functionalities.


Key Features of the Window Object:

1.Global Scope: Variables and functions declared in the global scope are attached to the window object. For example, if you declare a global variable like var x = 10;, you can access it as window.x.

2.Navigation: The window object provides methods for navigation, such as window.location to get information about the current URL or to navigate to a different URL.

3.Timers: Functions like setTimeout and setInterval are part of the window object, allowing you to schedule tasks and animations.

4.Alerts and Prompts: You can create dialog boxes like alerts and prompts using methods like window.alert() and window.prompt().


Key Differences

1.Scope: The document object deals primarily with the content and structure of the web page, while the window object is more concerned with browser-related functionalities and global scope.

2.Content vs. Browser: The document object is about the content within the browser, while the window object represents the browser itself.

3.DOM Manipulation: DOM manipulation is primarily performed using the document object.

4.Global Variables: Global variables and functions are properties of the window object.
